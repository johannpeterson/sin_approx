  abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

  abstract = {An accurate reduction poses little difficulty for arguments of a few radians. However for, say, a CRAY1, H format on the VAX, or double extended in the proposed IEEE standard, the maximum argument which might be presented for reduction is of the order of 2\textasciicircum 16000 radians. Accurate reduction of such an argument would require storage of Ï€ (or its reciprocal) to over 16,000 bits. Direct reduction by division (or multiplication) then requires generation of a somewhat larger number of bits in the result in order to guarantee the accuracy of the reduction. Of these bits only the low few bits of the integer part of the quotient (product) and enough bits to correctly round the remainder are relevant; the rest will be discarded.},
