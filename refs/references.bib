  abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

  abstract = {A commonly used argument reduction technique in elementary function computations begins with two positive floating point numbers /spl alpha/ and /spl gamma/ that approximate (usually irrational but not necessarily) numbers 1/C and C, e.g., C = 2/spl pi/ for trigonometric functions and ln 2 for e/sup x/. Given an argument to the function of interest it extracts z as defined by x/spl alpha/ = z + /spl sigmav/ with z = k2/sup -N/ and {\textbar}sigmav;{\textbar} /spl les/ 2/sup -N-1/, where k, N are integers and N /spl ges/ 0 is preselected, and then computes u = x - z/spl gamma/. Usually z/spl gamma/ takes more bits than the working precision provides for storing its significant and thus exact x - z/spl gamma/ may not be represented exactly by a floating point number of the same precision. This will cause performance penalty when the working precision is the highest available on the underlying hardware and thus considerable extra work is needed to get all the bits of x - z/spl gamma/ right. We present theorems that show under mild conditions that can be easily met on today's computer hardware and still allow /spl alpha/ /spl ap/ 1/C and /spl gamma/ /spl ap/ C to almost the full working precision, x - z/spl gamma/ is a floating point number of the same precision. An algorithmic procedure based on the theorems is obtained. The results will enhance performance, in particular on machines that has hardware support for fused multiply-add (fma) instruction(s).},

However for, say, a CRAY1, H format on the VAX, or double extended in the proposed IEEE standard, the maximum argument which might be presented for reduction is of the order of 2{\textasciicircum}16000 radians. Accurate reduction of such an argument would require storage of {$\pi$} (or its reciprocal) to over 16,000 bits. Direct reduction by division (or multiplication) then requires generation of a somewhat larger number of bits in the result in order to guarantee the accuracy of the reduction. Of these bits only the low few bits of the integer part of the quotient (product) and enough bits to correctly round the remainder are relevant; the rest will be discarded.},
